                    As a psychologist, HR professional and a life coach, I've had the previlege of guiding over 2,000 individuals to become more confident, and empowered in their personal and professional lives.
                    <br><br>My approach is centered on creating a safe, open space for my students to express themselves, discover their strengths and unlock their dormant potential. To me, learning is not just about gaining skills. It's also about shaping a more refined, confident and compassionate version of oneself.

                    With an MBA from Mahatma Gandhi University and an MS in psychology from the Higher School of Economics, Moscow, I have a strong academic background in understanding different types of people and businesses. 
                    <br><br>My professional experience is diverse. Initially I started as a sales executive and went on to work as an HR officer at Bharat Heavy Electricals for six years until I secured a fully funded scholarship to do my MS in Russia. In Russia, I worked as a part time English trainer and also obtained a Cambridge certification (CELTA) in teaching English as a foreign language. 
                    <br><br>After returning to India in 2021, I continued teaching English online and began my journey with Amrita University as a soft skills trainer. I find teaching and mentoring a very fulfilling experience and I am constantly trying to learn new things which I can share with my students.
